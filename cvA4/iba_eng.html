            </div>
            <div style="font-size: 14px;">
                I am motivated by the prospect of joining IBA as a Data Engineer.
                The idea of working in a company that pushes the boundaries in cancer treatment and places innovation at the core of its mission resonates deeply with me.
                With my skills in data engineering, I am eager to contribute to concrete projects that not only optimize operations but also add real value to the teams.

                <b>Alignment with Key Values</b>
            </div>
            <div style="font-size: 14px;">
                <div><b>Data engineer</b></div>
                In my current role, I have gained solid experience as a Data Engineer by adapting ERP systems for various clients. 
                I am responsible for connecting data from the application database to the front-end, creating interactive dashboards that facilitate production 
                cycle analysis—such as those for machining equipment to calculate production efficiency—or summary sales dashboards to identify top clients and 
                best-selling products. These projects have allowed me to optimize the user interface while fully leveraging available data, an aspect 
                I am eager to further develop in an innovation-driven environment.
                <div style="margin-top: 5px;"><b>Python and SQL</b></div>
                Python and SQL are my preferred languages. I have been using Python since version 2.7, both for personal projects and in my current role, 
                where it is prioritized to meet client needs. I particularly appreciate its clear syntax and readability, although I also have experience with C and C++.
                <br/>
                As for SQL, PostgreSQL is my preferred database due to its performance and advanced features as a relational database. I have also worked with MySQL, 
                MSSQL, and SQLite, appreciating SQLite’s lightweight nature, though its performance is more limited.
                <div style="margin-top: 5px;"><b>Database modeling</b></div>
                I have a strong command of database modeling techniques, particularly the conceptual data model (CDM) and logical data model (LDM), which I studied 
                during my university coursework and regularly use in my personal projects. In my current company, the lack of formal database modeling makes tasks 
                such as maintenance, updates, and project handovers more complex. This experience has convinced me of the importance and benefits that good modeling 
                can provide in terms of clarity, process fluidity, and solution sustainability. I am therefore especially motivated to bring this expertise to a 
                Data Engineering team.
                <div style="margin-top: 5px;"><b>Cloud (Azure)</b></div>
                I gained a solid understanding of Microsoft Azure during my bachelor’s degree in computer science through courses on network administration, 
                where I learned to create and manage interconnected virtual machines in this cloud environment. Since then, I have been using Azure for personal 
                needs, deploying virtual machines as needed while managing usage due to the hourly costs. Additionally, in my current position, I manage program 
                instances for our clients on VPS hosted by a French provider, which allows me to further develop my skills in server administration and 
                application deployment.
                <div style="margin-top: 5px;"><b>Continuous integration/deployment</b></div>
                I am well-versed in continuous integration and deployment principles, including code versioning with GitHub, where branching and pull requests play a crucial role. These processes allow a third party to review code changes before they reach production, ensuring quality and adherence to standards. I understand the importance of thorough testing as a safeguard against regressions during updates, which is vital for maintaining stability. Additionally, I have experience in deployment processes, ensuring that releases are handled smoothly and that any issues are addressed promptly. These are practices I already implement in my current role, and I am committed to upholding high standards in both integration and deployment workflows.
